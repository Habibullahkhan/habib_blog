## Introduction



## History
Predecessors of the HMI include the Batch Interface (1945 - 1968), Command line interface (1969 - present), and the graphical user interface (1981 - present).

The concept of command line interface originated when typewriter machines were connected to computers in 1950, and offered results on demand. 
The batch interface was deliver result on demand. A basic example of command line would be windows Disk Operating System "DOS" which dominated the 1980's. 
Graphical user interface evolved in 1980's. It allowed people to interact with programs in more visual manner, such as via symbols on touch screen rathar than commands. 
The modern HMI directly stems from Grahpical User Interfaces, formerly known as Man Machine Interface. They are leading the way in control of manufacturing processes. 
Color coding and icons are used for easy identification. The biggest challenge for any HMI is how to instructits user. There are a lot of information in a machine. How can a designer present that information in the most user-friendly way (UX design). Color coding and icons are big help. A red color can be used for crticial information such as warning. A lock icon can be used for security related information.

When we human communicate with each other. We use language as the prime source. But we use other cues. That are unconsious. Face gestures, body language, and a lot of context. The biggest challenge for any HMI is context. The machine does not know the context.

If you ask a coffee machine to prepare a coffee. You have to tell it a specific coffee. It does not know your context of how tired you are etc.
